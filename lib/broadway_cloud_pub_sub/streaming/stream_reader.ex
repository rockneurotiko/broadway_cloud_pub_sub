  # A short-lived process that owns the gRPC bidirectional streaming connection
  # and forwards decoded messages to the StreamManager.
  #
  # ## Why a separate process?
  #
  # The `grpc_client` library's `GRPC.Stub.recv/2` returns a blocking `Enumerable`.
  # A GenServer cannot block on enumeration (it would stop processing casts,
  # calls, and timers). By spawning a dedicated reader process, the GenServer
  # remains fully responsive while streaming runs concurrently.
  #
  # ## Message protocol with StreamManager
  #
  # After the stream is opened, this process sends the grpc_stream back:
  #
  #   `{:stream_opened, pid, grpc_stream}`
  #
  # Then it forwards received messages and lifecycle events:
  #
  #   `{:stream_messages, [ReceivedMessage.t()]}` — one or more decoded messages
  #   `{:stream_error, error}`                    — stream-level gRPC error
  #   `{:stream_closed}`                          — server closed stream normally
  #
  # On exit (normal or crash), the StreamManager detects it via the linked
  # process `{:EXIT, pid, reason}` signal (StreamManager traps exits).
  #
  # ## Sending on the stream (acks, deadline modifications)
  #
  # After receiving `{:stream_opened, _pid, grpc_stream}`, the StreamManager
  # calls `grpc_client.send_request(grpc_stream, request, client_config)` directly
  # from the GenServer process. Both the Gun and Mint adapters implement this as a
  # fire-and-forget cast, safe to call from any process concurrently with the
  # reader process enumerating the receive stream.
