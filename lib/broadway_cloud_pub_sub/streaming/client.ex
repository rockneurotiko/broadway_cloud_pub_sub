defmodule BroadwayCloudPubSub.Streaming.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for gRPC interactions used by the streaming Pub/Sub producer.

  The default implementation is `BroadwayCloudPubSub.Streaming.GrpcClient`.
  Provide a custom module via the `:grpc_client` option on
  `BroadwayCloudPubSub.Streaming.Producer` for testing or alternate transports.

  ## Implementing a custom client

  A custom client module must implement all callbacks in this behaviour. The `init/1`
  callback receives the full producer options and returns an opaque `config` term that
  is stored in state and forwarded as the last argument to every subsequent call.

  Example:

      defmodule MyApp.FakeGrpcClient do
        @behaviour BroadwayCloudPubSub.Streaming.Client

        @impl true
        def init(opts), do: {:ok, Map.new(opts)}

        @impl true
        def connect(config), do: {:ok, :fake_channel}

        # ... implement remaining callbacks
      end

  Then configure the producer:

      {BroadwayCloudPubSub.Streaming.Producer,
       grpc_client: MyApp.FakeGrpcClient,
       subscription: "projects/my-project/subscriptions/my-sub",
       ...}

  Invoked once during producer startup to normalize options into a `config` term.

  The `config` term is stored in state and forwarded as the last argument to all
  subsequent callbacks, analogous to how `BroadwayCloudPubSub.Client.init/1`
  works for the pull producer.

  Opens a gRPC channel to the Pub/Sub service.

  detail of the client.
