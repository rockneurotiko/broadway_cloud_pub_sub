defmodule BroadwayCloudPubSub.Producer do
  @moduledoc """
  A Broadway producer that uses the gRPC StreamingPull API to receive
  messages from a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription.

  ## Overview

  This producer opens a persistent bidirectional gRPC stream to the Pub/Sub
  service and receives messages as the server pushes them. This is more
  efficient than the HTTP pull approach (`BroadwayCloudPubSub.Pull.Producer`) for
  workloads that require low latency or high throughput.

  Each producer process (N = `producer: [concurrency: N]`) starts and links
  its own **StreamManager** (GenServer), giving N independent gRPC streams
  sharing a single `clientID`.

  Key components:

    * **StreamManager** - GenServer that owns the gRPC bidirectional stream,
      manages connection lifecycle (connect/reconnect/backoff), extends message
      leases, and dispatches messages to the linked Producer when demand is
      available. Started via `start_link` from `Producer.init/1`.

    * **Producer** - GenStage process that bridges StreamManager to Broadway.
      Tracks downstream demand and forwards messages to processors.

    * **UnaryAckSupervisor** - shared across all producers. Supervises
      AckBatcher and UnaryRpcClient, which batch and send ack/nack/modifyAckDeadline
      requests via separate unary RPCs (not on the streaming connection).

  ## Usage

      Broadway.start_link(MyPipeline,
        name: MyPipeline,
        producer: [
          module:
            {BroadwayCloudPubSub.Producer,
             goth: MyApp.Goth,
             subscription: "projects/my-project/subscriptions/my-subscription",
             max_outstanding_messages: 1000}
        ],
        processors: [default: [concurrency: 10]]
      )

  ## Options

  #{NimbleOptions.docs(BroadwayCloudPubSub.Streaming.Options.definition())}

  ## Acknowledgements

  Use `:on_success` and `:on_failure` to control how messages are acknowledged
  with Pub/Sub. Both can also be changed per-message via
  `Broadway.Message.configure_ack/2`.

  Supported values:

    * `:ack` - acknowledge the message; Pub/Sub removes it from the subscription.
    * `:noop` - do nothing; the message is redelivered after the subscription's
      `ackDeadlineSeconds` expires.
    * `:nack` - equivalent to `{:nack, 0}`; makes the message immediately
      available for redelivery.
    * `{:nack, seconds}` - sets `ackDeadlineSeconds` to `seconds` for the
      message, controlling when it becomes available for redelivery (0-600).

  Acks and deadline modifications are batched by **AckBatcher** and flushed to
  Pub/Sub via unary RPCs at a configurable interval (`:ack_batch_interval_ms`,
  default 100ms) or when the batch reaches `:ack_batch_max_size` (default 2500).
  Batching is done on a separate unary connection, independently of the
  streaming connection. See [Telemetry](#module-telemetry) for ack-related events.

  ## Flow control

  Flow control is managed at the gRPC stream level via `:max_outstanding_messages`
  and `:max_outstanding_bytes`. The Pub/Sub server will not push more messages
  than these limits allow. This is the primary backpressure mechanism.

  StreamManager also tracks GenStage demand from the Producer and buffers
  messages internally when demand is zero, preventing unbounded mailbox growth.

  See also [Lease management](#module-lease-management) for how message deadlines
  are extended while flow control holds messages in the buffer.

  ## Lease management

  The producer automatically extends message acknowledgement deadlines before
  they expire. Leases are extended by sending `modifyAckDeadline` requests via
  the AckBatcher. The extension interval is derived from the effective ack
  deadline with randomized jitter to spread out RPC calls.

  Messages are tracked until they are acknowledged, nacked, or until
  `:max_extension_ms` elapses (default 60 minutes), after which the server
  redelivers them. This prevents a stuck consumer from holding messages
  indefinitely. The `extend_leases` and `lease_expired` telemetry events
  (see [Telemetry](#module-telemetry)) provide visibility into lease activity.

  ## Exactly-once delivery

  When the subscription has exactly-once delivery enabled, the server signals
  this via `StreamingPullResponse.subscription_properties`. The producer
  detects this automatically and enforces a minimum lease extension interval
  (the server requires at least 60 seconds between extensions for exactly-once
  subscriptions).

  For exactly-once subscriptions, increase `:retry_deadline_ms` to 600,000ms
  (10 minutes) to allow the unary RPC client enough time to retry transient
  ack failures - the server requires successful ack receipt before guaranteeing
  exactly-once semantics. The library automatically adjusts `:retry_deadline_ms`
  when the subscription's exactly-once status changes at runtime.

  ## Message ordering

  Set `enable_message_ordering: true` to route messages with the same
  `ordering_key` to the same Broadway processor, ensuring sequential processing
  per key. The subscription must also have message ordering enabled in Pub/Sub.

  Ordering is enforced via Broadway's `:partition_by` option, which is
  automatically injected into all processor groups when this option is set.

  ## Graceful shutdown

  On shutdown, the producer:

    1. Nacks all buffered messages (received but not yet dispatched to
       processors) per the `:on_shutdown` option (default `{:nack, 5}`).
    2. Stops the gRPC stream to prevent new messages from arriving.
    3. Waits up to `:drain_timeout_ms` (default 30s) for in-flight messages
       (dispatched to processors but not yet acked/nacked) to be processed.
    4. Force-closes the stream after the drain timeout.

  The drain lifecycle is tracked via the `drain` telemetry span
  (see [Telemetry](#module-telemetry)).

  ## Error handling

  gRPC stream errors are classified as retryable or terminal:

    * **Retryable** (e.g. `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`) -
      the stream is closed and reconnected after a backoff delay. A new OAuth2
      token is fetched on each reconnect.
    * **Terminal** (e.g. `NOT_FOUND`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) -
      the StreamManager stops and Broadway's supervision restarts the pipeline.

  Reconnect backoff is configurable via `:backoff_type`, `:backoff_min`, and
  `:backoff_max`. The default is randomized exponential (`:rand_exp`) starting
  at 100ms and capped at 60s.

  ## Pub/Sub Emulator

  To use with the local Pub/Sub emulator:

      {BroadwayCloudPubSub.Producer,
       subscription: "projects/my-project/subscriptions/my-subscription",
       grpc_endpoint: "localhost:8085",
       use_ssl: false,
       token_generator: {MyApp, :emulator_token, []}}

  ## Differences from `BroadwayCloudPubSub.Pull.Producer`

    * **Push-based**: Messages arrive via a persistent gRPC stream rather than
      being fetched on demand via HTTP pull requests.
    * **Flow control**: Controlled at the gRPC stream level via
      `:max_outstanding_messages` and `:max_outstanding_bytes` rather than
      per-request polling. See [Flow control](#module-flow-control).
    * **Graceful shutdown**: The stream is closed immediately on shutdown to
      stop new messages arriving; the unary channel stays up so in-flight
      messages can still be acked or nacked during the drain window. The pull
      producer has no drain phase. See [Graceful shutdown](#module-graceful-shutdown).
    * **Lease extension**: Message deadlines are extended automatically to
      prevent redelivery while processing. The pull producer relies on the
      subscription-level ack deadline only. See
      [Lease management](#module-lease-management).
    * **Enhanced telemetry**: Emits a richer set of events covering connection
      lifecycle, lease activity, ack/modack RPC spans, drain lifecycle, and
      per-cycle pressure snapshots. See [Telemetry](#module-telemetry).

  ## Telemetry

  This producer emits the following [Telemetry](https://github.com/beam-telemetry/telemetry)
  events. All events share the top-level prefix `[:broadway_cloud_pub_sub, :streaming]`,
  followed by a layer sub-prefix.

  All event metadata maps include an `:extra` key when the `:telemetry_metadata` option
  is configured. Its value is the static term provided, or the return value of the MFA
  called at emission time.

  ### Stream events - `[:broadway_cloud_pub_sub, :streaming, :stream, ...]`
